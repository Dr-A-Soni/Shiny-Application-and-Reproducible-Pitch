## ***Introduction:***

This presentation is part of the Developing Data Products Coursera.org course project submission.

It is an R Presentation generated with RStudio.

The Shiny application pitched for this presentation is at 


The Shiny app source code is available at:
https://github.com/Dr-A-Soni/Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch.

## ***Application Overview:***

- This Application is written in Shiny which is a web application framework for R Studio.

- The source code for this application consist of two files: server.R and ui.R.

- The ui.R includes the user-interface definition, wherein the sidebar layout template
is used, also with the main panel and provides the overall template for the code.

- The server.R includes the server logic of the Shiny web application.

- This application is hosted on R-studio's shiny server in the cloud(Shinyapp.io)

## ***How it works?***
###  ***The Application contains: Left Panel:***

- All the Left panel portion while the tabs and title in the main panel are all done in the ui.R

- The main title is written using the text Input in the ui.R.

- The first part of the panel is the selection of Random numbers using the
numericInput. I kept the range of the random numbers selection between 1 to 1000,
within which a range of number with minimum and maximum inputs are selected.

----

- Next is the selection of the mean under the slider panel. Here the option
for mean ranges from 0 to 100 and the slider provides an easy option to select 
any mean in that range from the panel.

- Following the mean option, comes the selection of the Standard Deviation. Its
selection is same as mean ranging from 0 to 100 by help of sliding panel.

-Finally the last button on the side panel is the Update Button, which refreshes
the selection and confirms it every time for a new plot and calculations. This 
option is carried out by using SubmitInput.

----

###  ***The Application contains: Main Panel:***

The main panel consist of 3 tabs, which were generated in ui.server. However,
the execution in this tabs is carried out through server.R

- The first tab show the plot of the normal distribution where the inputs are 
selected from the side Panel.
  - THe plot shows the distribution where the x axis is based on the range of the 
  random numbers selected from the first side panel.
  - THe plot point are orange in color with pch-shape(11), which generates the 
  normal bell curve using the rnorm, mean and standard deviation selected and process
  through the code of probability via dnorm.
  
---- 
  
- The second tab consist of the Histogram. The code is for this plot is also 
written in server.R like the previous plot.
  - It uses that same data as used in the previous plot. 
  -It basic criteria behind the tab is to just give you different understanding 
  as to how the plot and histogram are different in terms of view when written
  using same inputs.
  
- The third tab is the Probability Tab. 
  - This tab calculates the probability using the formula provided in the
  server.R and gives  you the answer.
  

## ***Conclusion:***
  
  The main Idea behind selection the topic of Probability and Distribution 
  is to provide a general idea how the normal distribution looks like, and 
  to present it in a way of a playful app, which will encourage an interest in 
  this field.
  This application is a basic and very easy to use even for someone who knows
  nothing about the  distribution and probability.
  It is also an easy tool for calculating probability for anyone requiring any
  in their work.
